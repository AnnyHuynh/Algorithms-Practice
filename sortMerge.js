// Cracking the Coding Interview: Question 10.1 page 149
//you are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order. 
function sortMerge(A, B){
  let len1 = A.length;
  let len2 = B.length;
 
}
console.log(sortMerge([3, 8], [2, 6, 7]));
